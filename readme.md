## About

The purpose of this project is to enhance the translation and localization experience for WordPress users. The plugin adds a new column called "Translate me" to the plugin list screen in the WordPress admin panel. This column specifically targets plugins that exist on the WordPress translation platform, translate.wordpress.org, and have been properly prepared for localization.

The plugin aims to address several problems related to plugin translation and localization. First, it helps users identify which plugins are available for translation. If a plugin is not found on WordPress.org or its translation project is missing, a notice is displayed, providing transparency and information about why the translation may be incomplete.

By integrating the color scheme used in GlotPress, the translation management software used by translate.wordpress.org, the plugin ensures consistency in the translation experience across different platforms.

The significance of this project lies in its ability to improve the lives of WordPress users worldwide. WordPress is a popular content management system used by millions of websites globally. Many users rely on plugins to extend the functionality of their websites, and having these plugins available in multiple languages greatly enhances the accessibility and usability of WordPress for non-English speakers.

What sets this project apart from related ones is its focus on seamless integration with translate.wordpress.org and its emphasis on proper localization preparation. By providing a clear indication of which plugins are ready for translation, users can have confidence in the quality and completeness of the localized versions. This project aims to streamline the translation process and ultimately improve the overall experience for WordPress users seeking multilingual support for their websites.

**Should I translate both the Stable and Development versions?**
